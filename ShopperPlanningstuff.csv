Some nights they do not want to cook at all and are looking for quick, delicious, ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat options.

Products are not categorized by the way users shop, i.e users shop for coffee by type such as ground coffee, whole bean coffee, bottled coffee, etc.. vs users shop for soda by brand such as coca cola, pepsi, sprite, etc..

We don't personalize the products on the aisles based on user's past purchase or past shopping behaviors. 
On L3 page, users are forced to do too much scrolling because products are not integrated into shoppable carousels.

SLOC is a pass-thru API service combining data inpuuted in Store Locator provider (YEXT) and  ERUM's ecommerce store setup too.  SLOC powers website, mobile app, and other systems that rely on store level data.  does not have a User-Interface to add/remove store level attributes. 

Problem Statement:
There has been a request to expire the Erums ecom store setup tool and associated API and move all functions to SLOC. In order to support this request, this requires SLOC to develop a User Interface to manage data (add, delete, change) as well as to clean-up data to fit SLOC model.
